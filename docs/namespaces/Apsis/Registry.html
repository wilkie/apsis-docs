          Contains a registry of all actions that exist in the system. Actions   are an input-triggered event. For instance, you may have an Action for   "jump" that can be bound to a key. The rules in the game will respond   to a held or triggered action.

        <p class='description'>
          Contains a registry of all properties in the system. A property is a   key of which an object can have a value. For instance, a common   property for an object to have would be "hitPoints" which contains the   health of the actor. Events can trigger rules that will then subtract   or add to this value for an object.
